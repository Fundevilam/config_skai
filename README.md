# config_skai
Hi! This is the config I usually use (I like to try different stuff from time to time).

## Includes:
- Graphics config (mastercomfig 9.9.0 with some personal tweaks to enhance visibility specially for sniper)
- My binds
- NNull-Canceling Movement script
- Net graph on scoreboard script
- Comp aliases (to change maps quickly)
- The network settings I use on every class

## Installation
- 1: I recomend doing a cleanup to reset your tf2 cfg completely and get rid of any commands left by previous configs that might interfear with mine. For that I recomend following the steps on the [Mastercomfig Documentation](https://docs.mastercomfig.com/latest/setup/clean_up/)
- 2: After the cleanup drop the files inside my "cfg" folder into your own "cfg" folder and do the same for the custom folder (unless you want to use your own custom files)
- 3: Launch the game using the launch options **-dxlevel 81 -w 1920 -h 1080 -novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -nohltv -particles 1 -precachefontchars -noquicktime -console** (remove the "-dxlevel" option after first launch)

## Customization
Most changes regarding graphics can be changed in "comfig.cfg". Mastercoms did an amazing job of documenting what each command does so you should be able to understand what you're doing.
Regarding network settings, I would recomend changing them in each class ".cfg" file and not in "comfig.cfg" but do whatever you want.

## Credits
- Mastercoms for creating and continously updating one of the best tf2 configs around
- Povohat for creating the Null-Canceling Movement script

Have fun! <3
